# Claude Ubuntu Sandbox Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and design of the Claude Ubuntu Sandbox environment, which provides a persistent operating environment for Claude with self-improvement capabilities.

## Overview

The Claude Ubuntu Sandbox combines features from multiple projects to create a comprehensive environment where Claude can operate with:

1. A full Ubuntu desktop environment
2. 2. Persistent memory across sessions
   3. 3. Advanced input/output capabilities
      4. 4. Self-improvement mechanisms
         5. 5. Air-gapped testing capabilities
           
            6. ## Core Components
           
            7. ### 1. Docker-based Ubuntu Desktop
           
            8. The foundation of the system is a Docker container running a full Ubuntu desktop environment, accessible via:
            9. - Browser-based VNC (noVNC)
               - - Direct VNC connection
                 - - SSH (optional)
                  
                   - ### 2. Claude Integration Layer
                  
                   - This layer connects Claude's API to the Ubuntu environment, allowing it to:
                   - - Execute shell commands
                     - - Interact with the desktop GUI
                       - - Read and write files
                         - - Use advanced input/output devices
                          
                           - ### 3. Memory Persistence System
                          
                           - The MCP (Master Control Program) server provides:
